# Watchdog for your Chia farm

So you've become a [Chia](https://www.chia.net) farmer and want to maximize the probability of getting a reward? Chiadog
helps with automated monitoring and sends you a mobile notification in case something appears to malfunction.

## Supported Notifications

| Subsystem | Notification (example values) | Priority |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------|
| Harvester | Your harvester appears to be offline! No events for the past 400 seconds. | HIGH |
| Harvester | Disconnected HDD? The total plot count decreased from 100 to 40. | HIGH |
| Harvester | Experiencing networking issues? Harvester did not participate in any challenge for 120 seconds. It's now working again. | NORMAL |
| Harvester | Seeking plots took too long: 40 seconds! | NORMAL |
| Harvester | Found 1 proof(s)! | LOW |
| Full Node | Experiencing networking issues? Skipped some signage points! Last 12/64, current 43/64. | NORMAL |

## How it works?

It parses the `debug.log` generated by the chia process and runs various checks to determine the health of your farmer.
Among others, it can detect if your node has lost sync and the farmer is no longer participating in challenges, or if
one of your external HDDs disconnected and your harvester doesn't have access to the full amount of plots you have.

## Supported Integrations for Notifications

The following integrations are **optional** - `chiadog`
is not dependent on any of them and can also run standalone. That being said, you'll get the most value out of it, when
you connect with one of the services below to receive real-time notifications about important events. You can also
enable more than one at the same time - please refer to the [config-example.yaml](config-example.yaml).

### Pushover

[Pushover](https://pushover.net/) is available for both Android and iOS. High priority notifications can be configured
from the Pushover app to overwrite any Silence or Do-Not-Disturb modes on your phone and sound a loud alarm at any time
of the day to make you aware of any issues in a timely manner.

- **Costs**: ~$5 one time payment for mobile app after 30 day trial.
- **Advantages**: Easy setup, high priority notifications can override your phone's silent mode.

You can test if your the setup works correctly with:

```
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN=<api_token> PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=<user_key> python3 -m unittest tests.notifier.test_pushover_notifier
```

### Telegram

This integration uses the [Telegram's Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots). You can create a new bot for yourself
by [sending a message to BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

For `chat_id` you need to enter your Telegram username or ID. For me only ID worked, you can find out your Telegram ID
by messaging the [IDBot](https://telegram.me/myidbot). You need to also first message your bot to make sure it knows
about you and can send you notifications.

- **Costs**: $0
- **Advantages**: It's free and not additional apps are required.

You can test if your bot works correctly with:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<bot_token> TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<your_id> python3 -m unittest tests.notifier.test_telegram_notifier
```

### Custom Script (beta)

*Beware: This feature is in **beta** stage and future versions might not maintain backward compatibility!
Currently, you need to parse out information from the message text which might change. In the future there'll be a
different mechanism for identifying message type and payload.*

Test your script is called correctly with:

```
python3 -m unittest tests.notifier.test_script_notifier
```

### SMTP / E-Mail

This integration uses SMTP to send an e-mail to a designated address. 
Alert information is sent in the subject line of the e-mail. 
There several free SMTP relay providers with reasonable limits,
some require that you have a domain name to verify the sender email.

- **Costs**: $0+
- **Advantages**: If you already have an SMTP server this can get the alert most-anywhere.

Test your script is called correctly with:

```
SENDER="sender@example.com" SENDER_NAME="ChiaDog" RECIPIENT="you@example.com" HOST=smtp.example.com PORT=587 USERNAME_SMTP=username PASSWORD_SMTP=password python3 -m unittest tests.notifier.test_smtp_notifier

```

### Slack, WhatsApp, ...?

These integrations can be easily added. Contributions are welcome!

# Getting started

## Pre-requisites

- UNIX-based OS (Linux/Mac) - contributions to support Windows are welcome!
- Python 3.7+
- Enabled `INFO` logs on your chia farmer

### How to enable INFO logs on chia farmer?

First configure the log level to `INFO`. This ensures that all logs necessary for chiadog to operate are available
under `~/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log`.

```
chia configure -log-level=INFO
```

Then restart your farmer to apply the changes:

```
chia start --restart farmer
```

Check that logs are coming in:

```
cat ~/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log
```

## Installation

_For updating from previous version, see section below._

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/martomi/chiadog.git
cd chiadog
```

2. Create virtual env (Recommended)

```
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
pip3 install wheel && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Copy the example config file

```
cp config-example.yaml config.yaml
```

5. Open up `config.yaml` in your editor and configure Pushover.
    - Enable Pushover Notifier
    - Set your Pushover API token
    - Set your Pushover user key

## Updating to the latest release

_Skip this if you followed above section_.

```
cd chiadog
. ./venv/bin/activate

git fetch
git checkout main
git pull

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> Important: Automated migration of config is not supported. Please check that your `config.yaml` has all new fields introduced in `config-example.yaml` and add anything missing.

## Monitoring a local harvester / farmer

1. Open `config.yaml` and configure `file_log_consumer`:
    - You need to enable the file log consumer to read local chia log files
    - Double-check that the path to your chia logs is correct

2. Start the watchdog

```
python3 main.py --config config.yaml
```

3. Verify that your plots are detected. Within a few seconds you should see INFO log:

```
Detected new plots. Farming with 42 plots.
```

## Remote monitoring of multiple harvesters

You can run multiple instances of `chiadog` on a single machine and monitor all your harvesters remotely. The logs on
remote machines are accessed through SSH, so you'll have to setup ssh-key based authentication with your harvesters.

### Setting up SSH keys

This step only takes a minute, follow Github's guide
on [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
. If you specify password for your key, you'll also need to follow the second step in the guide and add your SSH key to
the ssh-agent. The ssh-agent should remember and manage your password because `chiadog` doesn't know it.

### Copy SSH key to all machines running a harvester

On Linux you can use [ssh-copy-id](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id):

```
ssh-copy-id <user>@<ip_address>
```

which will take your default SSH key, or specify it explicitly:

```
ssh-copy-id -i "~/.ssh/id_ed25519" <user>@<ip_address>
```

### Prepare configs for each harvester

1. Open `config.yaml` in your editor and enable`network_log_consumer`.
    - Make sure that `file_log_consumer` is disabled (or delete that section)
    - Configure `remote_user` for your remote harvester machine
    - Configure `remote_host` for your remote harvester machine
    - Double check that `remote_file_path` exists on the remote machine

2. Copy `config.yaml` into multiple configs for each remote harvester, e.g.:

- `cp config.yaml config-harvester-1.yaml`
- `cp config.yaml config-harvester-2.yaml`
- `cp config.yaml config-harvester-3.yaml`

3. Adjust the `remote_user` and `remote_host` for each machine.
    - You can also specify different `notification_title_prefix` so that you can more easily distinguish between
      notification from each of your harvesters.

4. Start `chiadog` for each harvester in a separate terminal. I recommend [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
   as it allows you to split your terminal in multiple windows and have a cockpit-like overview.

```
python3 main.py --config config-harvester-1.yaml
python3 main.py --config config-harvester-2.yaml
python3 main.py --config config-harvester-3.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

The best way to check that everything works on your system is to run the unit tests:

```
python3 -m unittest
```

All tests are expected to complete with an `OK` status. It's highly recommended to also run the notification specific
tests described in the notification section above.

You can enable more verbose logging from `config.yaml` by changing `INFO` to `DEBUG`. You should see logs for every
keep-alive event from the harvester.

## Advanced Stuff

### Running `chiadog` in the background

```
nohup python3 -u main.py --config config.yaml > output.log &
```

To stop chiadog, you can find the Process ID (PID) via `ps aux | grep main.py` and then softly interrupt the process
with `kill -SIGINT <pid_here>`.

### I'm getting spammed by skipped signage point notifications!

You might be plotting too hard or your computer cannot keep up for some other reason. You shouldn't be getting more than
10 of these notifications per day. In a future version there'll be configuration to adjust the threshold or to only send
a daily summary on skipped signage points.

For now, if you don't want to get bothered by them, I recommend to
replace [this line](https://github.com/martomi/chiadog/blob/main/src/chia_log/handlers/finished_signage_point_handler.py#L96)
with `return None`. This will only stop the signage point notifications. You still will get notified about more critical
issues.

### Running `chiadog` in sandboxed environment

We're in the early stages of exploring the best way to provide easy to setup sandboxed environment where the `chiadog`
process is completely isolated from potentially accessing your private keys. Contributions in that direction are very
welcome. Meanwhile you can check out @ajacobson repository
for [chiadog-docker](https://github.com/ajacobson/chiadog-docker).
