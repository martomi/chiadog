# We support a lot of notifiers, please check the README for more
# information. You can delete the sections which you aren't using.
# You can also enable more than one notifier and send different
# notifications to each of them. E.g. enable daily_stats only to E-mail.
# If you enable wallet_events you'll get notifications anytime your
# wallet receives some XCH (e.g. farming reward).
#
# NOTE: No notifier is enabled by default, and all notification topics are disabled by default.
# You'll need to enable the notifiers and topics that you want to see!
