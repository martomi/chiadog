    If a service stopped responding and is no longer
    sending events, this class will trigger a high priority
    user event and propagate it to the notifier.

    There's also an option to enable pinging to a remote service
    that provides a second layer of redundancy. E.g. if this monitoring
    thread crashes and stops responding, the remote service will stop
    receiving keep-alive ping events and can notify the user.
